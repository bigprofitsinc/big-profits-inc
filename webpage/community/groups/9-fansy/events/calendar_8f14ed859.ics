SUMMARY:West ham v Brighton
DESCRIPTION:Match preview

West Ham United striker Chicharito (hamstring) is set to return after missing training in midweek.

Defenders James Collins (ankle) and Diafra Sakho (back) remain sidelined, but Adrian is in contention after recovering from illness.

Brighton & Hove Albion's Shane Duffy (groin) could be fit for the trip to the London Stadium. 

Sam Baldock and Beram Kayal are both out, while Tomer Hemed serves the last match of his suspension. 

Did you know?

West Ham United have won both of their previous home Premier League matches on a Friday, 1-0 against both Coventry City in December 1997 and Tottenham Hotspur last season.

Brighton & Hove Albion have won only one point (W0 D1 L3) and scored one goal in their four Premier League away matches.

The Hammers have kept a clean sheet in five of their last seven Premier League matches at London Stadium.

Pascal Gross, who has been involved in 83% of Brighton’s six goals this season, has created the same number of chances as Kevin De Bruyne (211) since August 2015.

What the managers say

Slaven Bilic: "We know they will make it difficult for us this evening, and we will need to be fully focused and maybe patient."
