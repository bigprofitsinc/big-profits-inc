SUMMARY:Joomla World Conference 2017
DESCRIPTION:The Joomla! World Conference (JWC) is an annual user conference aimed at users of the award winning Joomla! content management system.

A mix of keynotes, presentations, workshops and sessions will spread over three days in both English and Italian with simultaneous translation ensuring that the broadest content is accessible to all.
