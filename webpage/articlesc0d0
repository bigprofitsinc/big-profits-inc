<ul><li>Image Module which holds the image beneath the menu. This is a Custom module that you can edit to change the image.</li><li>Most Read Posts which lists articles based on the number of times they have been read.</li><li>Older Articles which lists out articles by month.</li><li>Syndicate which allows your readers to read your posts in a news reader.</li><li>Popular Tags, which will appear if you use tagging on your articles. Just enter a tag in the Tags field when editing.</li></ul>
<p>Each of these modules has many options which you can experiment with in the Module Manager in your site Administrator. Moving your mouse over a module and clicking on the edit icon will take you to an edit screen for that module. Always be sure to save and close any module you edit.</p>
<p>Joomla! also includes many other modules you can incorporate in your site. As you develop your site you may want to add more module that you can find at the <a href="https://extensions.joomla.org/">Joomla Extensions Directory.</a></p>]]></description>

<h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
<h5>For the chocolate pie filling:</h5>
<ul><li>12 ounces firm&nbsp;<strong>silken firm&nbsp;tofu</strong></li><li>1/2 cup&nbsp;Almond Breeze Chocolate&nbsp;<strong>Almondmilk</strong></li><li>1/2 cup&nbsp;<strong>almond butter</strong></li><li>12 ounces&nbsp;<strong>chocolate chips*</strong></li><li><strong>flaky sea salt</strong>&nbsp;for topping</li></ul>
<h5>For the Crust:</h5>
<ul><li>pie crust of your choice! ideas in the notes section.</li></ul>
<hr>
<h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
<ol><li><strong>Chocolate Pie Filling:&nbsp;</strong>Blend the tofu, almondmilk, and almond butter until smooth. Melt the chocolate chips. Add to the blender and blend until smooth – it gets pretty thick so you might need to help it along with a spatula between blends.</li><li><strong>Chocolate Pie Assembly:&nbsp;</strong>Pour filling into a crust, sprinkle with sea salt if you want, and chill for 12-24 hours. Cut and serve!</li></ol>
<h4>NOTES</h4>
<ul><li>*For strict vegans, use dairy-free chocolate chips – we found them at stores like Whole Foods.</li><li>We used chocolate almondmilk and it was deeeelicious. Bonus: the leftover milk sitting in my fridge has become my new favorite morning drink of choice.</li><li>Crust ideas: my favorite is a graham cracker crust, and unless I’m missing something major, it looks like most &nbsp;of the store-bought ones are vegan because they use oils instead of butter! Online forums support my findings, but if you know something I don’t, feel free to comment. I also love the idea of an Oreo crust or a regular pie crust, which you can make with coconut oil to be vegan. Also: a date and nut crust could be nice.</li></ul>]]></description>
